# GreenfootPIRobotPrototype

Greenfoot model to play with swarm aspects of PI robots

Most recent question is how to simulate a user interface.  
Playing with a few of the UI libraries, it appears that
AWT may be the best staring point.  Currently there is
a simple awt.java class added to the codebase that pops
up a sample program with some buttons when the "a" key
is pressed.  Need to add a toggle to that logic (in the 
RobotWorld code) and then see if it is easy to interact
with a running greenfooot program from the awt instance.
